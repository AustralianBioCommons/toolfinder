## About

The purpose of ToolFinder is to present a landscape view of bioinformatics software packages & tools 
installed across Australian national computational infrastructures, including:

- [National Computational Infrastructure](https://nci.org.au/) (NCI)
- [Pawsey Supercomputing Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/) (Pawsey)
- [Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation](https://www.qcif.edu.au/) (QCIF) / [QRISCloud](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/)
- [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au/)

ToolFinder also:

1. Presents relevant metadata for each of these tools, which is sourced from {% tool "biotools" %},
2. Provides connections to other global registries as appropriate, and based on user feedback (e.g. {% tool "biocontainers" %}), and
3. Provides, where possible, the ability to directly access (or `launch`) bioinformatics tools. The **only** current example of this is for [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au/).
