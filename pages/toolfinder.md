<p>This page lists bioinformatics tools and software that are installed
  across several of the <a href="http://support.biocommons.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000251977-compute-systems-at-the-biocommons-partner-infrastructures"><strong>BioCommons
      infrastructure partner systems</strong></a>. Tool / software status on
  other infrastructure partner systems will be added over time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Table last updated <code>2023-09-01</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>Tool identifier</code> column (hidden by default) contains
    an identifier for the tool / workflow: typically the module name (used
    for matching to HPC lists).</li>
  <li>The <code>Topic(s)</code> column categorises the tools by purpose,
    using an <a href="https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology">EDAM</a>
    <em>term</em> where possible.
  </li>
  <li>More information about a tool can be found by following the
    <code>[bio.tools links](https://bio.tools/)</code>.
  </li>
  <li>When a tool has been containerised to allow for easier installation
    on any compute infrastructure, a link to the containerised software that
    can be downloaded from <a href="https://biocontainers.pro/#/">BioContainers</a> is shown in the
    <code>Containers available? (BioContainers)</code> column.
  </li>
  <li>The source material for the table is currently manually curated, and
    while we endeavour to keep the information as current as possible, there
    is a natural limit to the volume of information maintained here.
    Production of this information will be automated over time, and tools
    that are not relevant for bioinformatics analyses removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FAQ: How can I get a HPC allocation?</strong></p>
<p>Allocation of computational resources to individual researchers on
  partner HPC and cloud infrastructures is through the usual channels
  offered via each partner (see instructions for each by following these
  links: <a href="https://nci.org.au/users/how-access-nci">NCI</a>, <a href="https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Getting+Access">Pawsey</a>,
  <a href="https://www.qcif.edu.au/services/computing/">QCIF</a>, <a href="http://cloud.nectar.org.au/start-now/">ARDC’s Nectar Research
    Cloud</a>). The <a href="https://www.biocommons.org.au/biocloud">BioCommons BioCloud</a>
  activity is working with these partners to examine ways to make it
  easier for life science researchers to receive HPC and HTC
  allocations.
</p>
<p>Note that access to computational resources via the <a href="https://usegalaxy.org.au/">Galaxy Australia</a> hosted web
  platform is unlimited for Australian researchers thanks to our
  computational partners (ARDC’s Nectar Research Cloud, University of
  Queensland, QCIF, University of Melbourne and Pawsey) who underpin the
  Galaxy Australia service.</p>
