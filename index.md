Table last updated **2024-01-12**.

- The **Tool identifier** column (hidden by default) contains an identifier for the tool / workflow: typically the module name (used for matching to HPC lists).
- The **Topic(s)** column categorises the tools by purpose, using an [EDAM](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology) concept where possible. 
- More information about a tool can be found by following the [bio.tools links](https://bio.tools/). 
- When a tool has been containerised to allow for easier installation on any compute infrastructure, a link to the containerised software that can be downloaded from [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) is shown in the **Containers available? (BioContainers)** column. 
- The source material for the table is currently manually curated, and while we endeavour to keep the information as current as possible, there is a natural limit to the volume of information maintained here. Production of this information will be automated over time, and tools that are not relevant for bioinformatics analyses removed.
